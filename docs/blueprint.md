# **App Name**: AIAssist

## Core Features:

- Text Generation: Takes a user prompt and sends it to OpenAI to generate text.
- Prompt Input: A UI component where users can enter prompts.
- AI output: A UI component where users can view the text returned from OpenAI.
- Parameter adjustment: An interface where users can adjust various AI generation parameters such as 'temperature', 'presence penalty', and 'frequency penalty'.
- Authentication: Provide code to make authenticated requests to OpenAI's API using the user's API key. The OpenAI key is stored in the browser.
- Download: Ability to download a .txt file of the AI generated output.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep indigo (#4B0082) to reflect intelligence and depth.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to keep the interface neutral and focus attention on AI-generated text.
- Accent color: A muted teal (#70A1A1) for interactive elements, providing a subtle but clear visual cue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent actions and settings. Prefer monochrome icons for a clean, modern look.
- Divide the screen into logical sections: input, output, and settings. The layout should be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
- Subtle animations to indicate loading states, feedback on user input and transitions between interface states.
